## NandToTetris

An attempt at going through [NandToTetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), a course which breaks down the process of building a computer starting from the very basics (the Nand gate!). I'm following the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome) version and using the book The Elements of Computer Systems as well as the website, and attempting to complete all the projects and exercises.
